sentence=This library enables you to use 1 Interrupt from Hardware Timers on an ESP32 board to control 16 or more servo motors.
paragraph=Now these new 16 ISR-based Servo controllers just use one ESP32 Hardware Timer. The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers. Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks. This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.
